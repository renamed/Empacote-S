# Empacote-Se

Management server for C++ packages.

"**Empacote-se**" is a Portuguese term that translates roughly to "**Pack Yourself**." We selected this name because our solution creates both a server and a client project. Consequently, their names are "**Empacote-S**" (for Server) and "**Empacote-C**" (for Consumer). In Portuguese, both "S" and "C" are pronounced similarly, resulting in identical-sounding names. Moreover, the project's development in C++ further enhances its name's appeal.
